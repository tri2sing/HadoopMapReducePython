HadoopMapReducePython
=====================

Sameer Adhikari:

This repo contains material I created for a course that I offered at Intel in 2012.

I have included the code and data I used for the examples.

The code requires access to a Hadoop cluster where you can run streaming jobs.

Some of the examples have also been run on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce.
