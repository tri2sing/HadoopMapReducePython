PythonMapReduceHadoop
=====================

Sameer Adhikari:

This repo contains material I created for a three-day course that I offered at Intel in July 2013.

I have included the code and data for the examples I used in class.

The data for patent jobs is missing as it does not fit within GitHub limits.

The code requires access to a Hadoop cluster where you can run streaming jobs.

Some examples were run on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce without chainging the code that ran on the local cluster.
