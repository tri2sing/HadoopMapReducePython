HadoopMapReducePython
=====================

Sameer Adhikari:

This repo contains material I created for a course that I offered at Intel in 2012.

I have included the code for the examples I used in class.

I will upload some sample data for the examples once I can create smaller files that fit within GitHub limits.

The code requires access to a Hadoop cluster where you can run streaming jobs.

Some of the examples have also been run on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce.
